Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

This project used two datasets in csv format  schools_comple.csv and Students_complete_csv files.
To analyse these two files have been imported, merged and calculated the average and mean of maths and reading scores

Analysed the District Summary on the following key metrics
  Total number of unique schools
  Total students
  Total budget
  Average maths score
  Average reading score
  % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
  % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
Note: A passing grade is 50 or higher.

Analsed the School summary by creating the following metrics
  School name
  School type
  total students
  total school budget etc

  Then calculated the Top performing shcools by % overall passing rate
  And also bottom performing schools
  Then graded by Maths scores and Reading scores for all schools
